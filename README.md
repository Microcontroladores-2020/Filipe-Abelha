# Microcontroller course

The projects below are based on the PIC16F877A architecture and were executed using [PIC Simulator IDE](https://www.oshonsoft.com/pic.html).

## Project 1: Twinkling Lights
Starting with 0x55 (01010101), invert all bits using the COMF command.

## Project 2: Traffic Light
Starting with 0x01, shift left the active bit using the RLF command, going back to the LSB after reaching the MSB.
